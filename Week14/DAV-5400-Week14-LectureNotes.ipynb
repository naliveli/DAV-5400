    "## Feature Engineering: Concepts In Need of Review\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Create \"Interaction\" Features__: Interaction features are new metrics we __derive__ from our existing data (NOTE: we've already touched on this concept this semester).Examples include creating new ratios / proportions from our existing data as well as binning / bucketing of numeric data and the de-structuring of date / time values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Combining Sparse Classifications__: With categorical data, \"sparse classes\" are those that have very few observations within a particular categorical variable. Such \"sparse data\" can cause problems with a wide variety of predictive and machine learning models (e.g., causing the models to \"overfit\" the data use for model training purposes).  These challenges can oftentimes be overcome by combining sparse classes into new classifications that aggregate the sparse items based on some shared characteristic(s). How you identify such \"shared characteristics\" is highly subjective, i.e., you need to apply your __domain knowledge__ to identify them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Adding \"Dummy\" Variables__: As we've previously discussed, we cannot use raw categorical data as input to a model that requires numerical data. Instead, we create a new \"0/1\" binary indicator variable for each categorical data value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusing these concepts will derail your analytical work, so make sure you are clear on each of them!!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project 4 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting categorical values to digits __DOES NOT__ change the fact that the contents of the variable are CATEGORICAL. Converting categorical values to digits is simply a \"renaming\" of the categorical values and in the resulting digits have no more meaning for mathematical calculation purposes than do the original character-based categorical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation metrics __CANNOT__ be derived from raw categorical data (whether in string or digit format). When performing EDA work with categorical data it is best to make use of bar plots for purposes of understanding the relationship between categorical explanatory variables and the given response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dummy variables are derived from explanatory variables for purposes of model building. Failure to make use of dummy variables will result in your models being invalid.\n",

    "As data analytics practitioners, we can often find ourselves working with data pertaining to specific individuals, and that data can often contain very personal details that many individuals would, if they could, prevent others from using for any purpose. Furthermore, the ways in which we analyze and report on data we are working with can (whether intentionally or not) easily lead both ourselves and others to misleading or inaccurate analytical and/or interpretational conclusions. \n",

    "## Data Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is \"Data Ethics\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to Wikipedia __data ethics__ \"..refers to systemising, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct in relation to data, in particular personal data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifically, __individual rights__ (e.g., right to privacy, right to consent, etc.) should __always__ take precedence over institutional or commericial interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally, the practice of \"__Data Ethics__\" should apply to all collectors and disseminators of structured or unstructured data such as data analytics professionals, data brokers, governments, and large corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what are the guiding principles of data ethics?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to __dataethics.eu__ (https://dataethics.eu/data-ethics-principles/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- __INDIVIDUAL DATA CONTROL__: Humans should be in control of and empowered by their data. The individual has the primary control over the usage of their data, the context in which his/her data is processed and how it is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __TRANSPARENCY__: The purpose of and ways in which data is being processed must be fully transparent and explainable to the individual, including any potential risks to the individual such as economic, privacy, social, ethical, or societal consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __ACCOUNTABILITY__: All collectors and disseminators of structured and unstructured data should have guidelines in place to ensure that any use of personal data adheres to ethical data usage practices, and should ensure that such guidelines are honored by subcontractors. Furthermore, all collectors and disseminators of structured and unstructured data should ensure they have appropriate controls and systems in place to prevent hacking of the data they have amassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __EQUALITY__: All personal data should be treated in a consistent manner without adversely affecting any individual's self-determination and control of their personal information, and should not expose any individual to discrimination or stigmatisation, for example due to their financial, social or health related conditions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We are bombarded with misleading (and sometimes deliberately false) statistical data and statistics-based arguments on a daily basis via journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, and others who are attempting to impose their own points of view on us. Here are some great examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "- According to the American Statistical Association (ASA) (https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx) an ethical statistician \"..uses methodology and data that are relevant and appropriate; without favoritism or prejudice; and in a manner intended to produce valid, interpretable, and __reproducible results__. The ethical statistician does not knowingly accept work for which he/she is not sufficiently qualified, is honest with the client about any limitation of expertise, and consults other statisticians when necessary or in doubt.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A detailed set of guidelines from the ASA is provided here: https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EthicalGuidelines.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A key aspect of ethical statistical practice is __making your original data available for others to work with__. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another key aspect of ethical statistics is __accepting when your peers have determined that your analysis is invalid due to a flaw in the approach you chose to use to analyze your data__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another key aspect of ethical statistics is __ensuring that you've considered whether any confounding variables could have influenced your results, and be willing to accept that your results can be invalidated if a future researcher provides evidence that one or more confounding variables have either tangibly influenced your reported results or have rendered your analysis invalid__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is all to easy to find examples of either flawed or deliberately misleading statistical analysis, or instances in which researchers overtly refuse to share their original research data,  all of which could have been mitigated if the ASA's guidelines had been adhered to.\n"

    "What is \"disparate impact\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Disparate Impact is a form of indirect and often unintentional discrimination whereby certain criteria disproportionately favor certain groups over other groups. Disparate impact occures when what appears to be a neutral policy, rule, or practice has a disproportionate negative impact on members of a protected class (e.g., in the USA that includes minorities, the disabled, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "- A strength requirement might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants for a job\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requiring all applicants for promotion to receive a certain score on a standardized test could adversely affect candidates of color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, almost every selection methodology used by employers produces a degree of disparate impact because each methodology disproportionately excludes members of a protected group. Basic selection criteria such as background checks, credit checks, work experience, pre-employment tests, and minimum educational requirements can all lead to disparate impact if you subscribe to that theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "What do these examples have in common? Should the statistical analyses have been required to consider confounding variables?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What about the criminals? Are minorities being unfairly singled out for exclusion from apartment rentals? Is it legitimate for landlords and residents to want to prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from living in the same building or development?
